I am a Physics-educated ML Scientist, holding an MSc degree in Data Science & Machine Learning from the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), as well as a BSc and an MSc degree in Physics from the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (NKUA). 

I currently work as the lead Data & ML Engineer at SeaQuest Marine Technologies. In the meantime, I'm pursuing a PhD in Physics-Informed Neural Networks at NKUA, mainly focusing on using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for PDE problems and Symbolic Regression.

You can find a short CV [here](/cv), as well as a list of my publications and brief summaries [here](/publications) (click on an entry to read more details about it).
