In this open-access paper, which can be found [here](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/24/16/5310), we presented an end-to-end solution designed for Predictive Maintenance (PdM) of shipboard machinery. The framework covers the entire lifecycle from data collection at the edge to cloud processing and fault detection using a MTAD-GAT deep learning model. Below are brief summaries of its main constituents:
