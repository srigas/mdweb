# Experience

- #### Data Engineering & Machine Learning
SeaQuest Marine Technologies (_Sep. 2022 - Present_)  

> As the lead of Data & ML Operations, I supervise a multidisciplinary team of MLOps Developers, Data Scientists, Data and ML Engineers to design, develop, and deploy machine learning models into production. My team is focused on delivering scalable ML solutions to address key challenges in the marine industry, spanning from vessel performance optimization and emissions minimization to data-driven condition monitoring of shipboard machinery.


- #### Theoretical Physics Post-MSc Research
National & Kapodistrian University of Athens (_Mar. 2021 - Aug. 2022_)

> After completing my MSc studies, I continued my research on the topics explored in my thesis, titled "Solution of the tight-binding Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations for topological superconductivity". This work was supported by the 49th Scholarship Programme for Postgraduate and Doctoral Studies of the Bodossaki Foundation via scholarship with code BDA-2750.
